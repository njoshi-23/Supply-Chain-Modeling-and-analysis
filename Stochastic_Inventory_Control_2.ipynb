    "Luciano sells linguini that he imports from Italy in his restaurant shop. It takes about three weeks for the Italian company to ship an order and fixed costs of ordering amount to about \\\\$75.00 for bookkeeping expenses. The linguini costs Luciano \\\\$2.00 per packet and may be purchased in any quantity. Luciano told Mario that his holding costs were based on a 20%. annual rate, and he estimated that the loss of customer goodwill for not being able to provide the linguini when requested amounts to \\\\$25.00 (unit stockout cost). The demand for linguini has been uncertain, but looking at past data, Mario feels confident that the weekly demand for linguini is distributed Normal(12; 8)."
